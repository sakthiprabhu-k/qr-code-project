## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Figured out how to approach design.
- Learned how to make websites look good on different screens.
- Started writing code that's easier to understand and fix.

### Continued development

I'm still getting the hang of:

- Designing for mobile devices first, making websites look good on phones.
- Using media queries to adjust my designs for different screens.
- Ensuring my websites work well on different web browsers.
